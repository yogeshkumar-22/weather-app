<h1><a href="index.html"><img src="cloud.png" alt="">About</a></h1>
<p>In this project, I  have developed a user-friendly weather update application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>Our goal was to provide a seamless and visually appealing way for users to access real-time weather information for their chosen locations. The HTML structure forms the foundation of our web app, while CSS styling ensures an attractive and responsive design. JavaScript connects to a weather API, retrieves current weather data, and dynamically updates the user interface with temperature, conditions, and forecasts. Users can input their location, and our application instantly delivers up-to-date weather details, making it a handy tool for staying informed about changing weather patterns.</p>
